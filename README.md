# Ethereum Solar DApp test project

This project was bootstrapped with the Ethereum Starter App [Create React dApp](https://github.com/mjhm/create-react-dapp), which leverages the latest [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) and layers a template for creating Ethereum dApps using [TruffleFramework](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) and [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JavaScript-API)


## Starting the app

In the root directory of the project, install all dependencies

```
npm run install
```

Start a Ganache blockchain.

```
npm run ganache
```

In a separate terminal window, compile and deploy contracts, then start the app.

```
npm run migrate
npm start
```
